                    What is a cohabitation agreement?
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    A cohabitation agreement is a legally binding contract between two people who are living together 
                    or planning to live together in a romantic relationship but are not married. In Alberta, this agreement 
                    outlines how property, debts, and other financial matters will be handled during the relationship and 
                    in the event of separation.

                    Do I need a cohabitation agreement in Alberta?

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    While not legally required, a cohabitation agreement is highly recommended for unmarried couples in Alberta. 
                    Unlike married couples, common-law partners (called "adult interdependent partners" in Alberta) have limited 
                    property rights under Alberta's Family Property Act (2020). A cohabitation agreement provides clarity and 
                    protection for both parties regarding property division and support obligations.

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    You should consider a cohabitation agreement if you're planning to move in together, 
                    have significant assets or debts, own property together, have children from previous relationships, 
                    or want to clarify financial responsibilities and expectations in your relationship.

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                    <strong>Yes!</strong> Our cohabitation agreement is specifically drafted to function as both a cohabitation 
                    agreement and a prenuptial agreement. This means that if you decide to get married later, your existing 
                    agreement automatically continues to protect both parties as a marriage contractâ€”you won't need to purchase 
                    another contract.

                    <li>There's no need to create a separate prenuptial agreement if you decide to marry</li>
                    <li>Your financial arrangements and property agreements remain consistent through relationship changes</li>
                    <li>You save money by not having to purchase additional legal documents</li>

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    The agreement includes specific provisions that address both cohabitation and marriage scenarios, 
                    ensuring comprehensive protection regardless of your relationship status. This makes it an excellent 
                    investment for couples who are living together and may consider marriage in the future.

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-3">
                    Under Section 38 of Alberta's Family Property Act, if you want your cohabitation agreement to have 
                    the strongest legal protection, each party must obtain independent legal advice from separate lawyers. 
                    The Act specifically states that "the acknowledgements shall be made before a different lawyer for each party."
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    This requirement ensures that both parties fully understand the agreement and that it meets all legal 
                    requirements for enforceability. Courts will look much more favorably on agreements where both parties 
                    had independent legal representation from different lawyers.

                    Section 38 of the Family Property Act requires each party to have their own independent lawyer to 
                    ensure maximum legal protection. This means:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 mb-3 space-y-1">

                    <li>Each lawyer provides independent advice to their client only</li>
                    <li>This prevents conflicts of interest and ensures fair representation</li>
                    <li>Both lawyers confirm their clients understand the agreement's implications</li>

                    While agreements without separate lawyers may still be valid, following Section 38 provides the

                    Under Alberta's Family Property Act (2020), property is classified as either "exempt property"

                    the relationship). For adult interdependent partners, the division rules are complex and different 
                    from married couples. Your cohabitation agreement should clearly specify how all property will be

                    Under the Family Property Act (2020), Alberta courts generally respect cohabitation agreements that were 
                    fairly made with proper disclosure and independent legal advice. However, courts may set aside agreements 
                    if they are found to be significantly unfair, were made under duress, involved material non-disclosure, 
                    or if circumstances have changed dramatically since signing. The Act provides courts with discretion to 
                    ensure fair outcomes.

                    Should I use a template or hire lawyers?

                  <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                    While well-drafted templates can provide a starting point, Section 38 of the Family Property Act 
                    strongly encourages each party to obtain independent legal advice from separate lawyers for maximum 
                    legal protection. This is especially important if you have significant assets, complex financial 
                    situations, children, or business interests. Even with simpler situations, having both parties 
                    consult with different qualified Alberta family lawyers ensures your agreement meets all legal 
                    requirements and will be enforceable when needed.
