# Vercel Deployment Diagnostic

## Repository Info
- **Repository**: https://github.com/Kaligoo/alberta-family-contracts.git
- **Branch**: main
- **Latest Commit**: f17bb4a Add HTML test file for Vercel

## Files That Should Exist
- ✅ `app/page.tsx` (Next.js homepage)
- ✅ `public/index.html` (Static HTML test)
- ✅ `package.json` (Next.js dependencies)
- ✅ `next.config.ts` (Next.js configuration)
- ✅ `vercel.json` (Vercel configuration)

## Expected Behavior
1. Vercel should detect this as a Next.js project
2. It should build successfully (we confirmed local build works)
3. Either `/` route should serve the Next.js page OR `/index.html` should serve the static page

## If Still Getting 404
Check these Vercel settings:
1. **Project Settings → Git**: Is it connected to the right repo and branch?
2. **Project Settings → Build & Output**: Is the root directory correct?
3. **Deployments**: Are builds completing successfully?
4. **Functions**: Are there any function errors?
5. **Domains**: Is the domain configured correctly?

## Debugging Steps
1. Check Vercel dashboard for build logs
2. Verify the deployment is actually completing
3. Check if files are being uploaded to Vercel
4. Ensure domain is pointing to the right deployment
